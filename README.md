This folder is for Emily Eisner and Liza Cooper to try to look at the data on rent stabilized buildings in NYC that is made available by the NYC DOF.

The folder is designed to have four main sub-directories: data, code, temp, output

the data folder contains raw input data

the code folder contains all code to be tracked

temp folder is just for temporary files that do not need to be tracked

output is stuff that the code produces that we want to track
